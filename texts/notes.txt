TO DO:
- add search bar for ages, category, languages, genre, etc. (could use tags like mama's YT channel)
- add music, movies, tv shows, books, etc.
- add open sources (links to netflix, barnes and nobles, for reviews or places to watch/read/listen to the stuffs)
- use sql to store info about each item (book, song, show, movie, etc.)
- create a homepage
- Create a function where there is a heart icon that when clicked, it is added to the next-up list on stuff to watch so that all the other lists can be of
  shows that I want to watch and that I have watched. (ex: the korean section would have tv shows that i watched and r on my list and then i click the heart
  which saves it to the next-up/watch later list but still keeps it in the korean section as well)
        - Make an array instead of the divs in the tv.html page so that i dont have to keep copy/pasting for new movies and instead, add a tag that when a 
          loop is run, it'll add all the shows with the same tag (ex: korean, next-up, my-list, etc.) to the same list and they can have multiple tags.



Make a JS array that works as a sql table for the books and tv shows and then create ONE function that accesses that public variable to get the info.
    maybe make something similar for the html page instead of making hundreds of divs for each thingamajig.
